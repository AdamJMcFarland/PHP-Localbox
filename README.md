# PHP Localbox
Your inbox for local development.  View emails without actually sending any email!

PHP Localbox is a simple two-file PHP/MySQL application that installs in minutes.  You can easily incorporate it into your existing workflow to route all of your email messages into your Localbox when developing locally.  Messages are stored in a database table instead of actually being sent.  

You can then view them in your Localbox that is designed to look and feel like an actual inbox.  Localbox supports both plain text and HTML email messages, and has a responsive design for testing on mobile devices.
