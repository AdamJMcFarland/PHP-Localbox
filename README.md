# PHP Localbox
Your inbox for local development.  View emails without actually sending any email!

PHP Localbox is a simple two-file PHP/MySQL application that installs in minutes.  You can easily incorporate it into your existing workflow to route all of your email messages into your Localbox when developing locally.  It's designed to look and feel like an actual inbox.

## Why?

Have you ever set up a local PHP development environment such as WampServer or XAMPP, only to find that sending email is more difficult than it needs to be?  I created PHP Localbox because I needed a simple way to see the content of emails for our e-commerce store [Detailed Image](https://www.detailedimage.com/) when developing locally.  This makes it easy to see that an Order Confirmation message was sent to the correct email address and contained the proper information about the customer's order, for example.

## Other Use Cases

Maybe you're developing using a transactional email service and don't want to actually send a bunch of emails during development, but you would like to confirm that the content of those emails is correct.

Maybe you're rapidly protyping email content and you'd rather not fill up your inbox.

Or, maybe you'd like to confirm that an email will be sent to multiple recipients in production, but don't want to actually send it now.
